Accompanied by text files which hold examples to test the functions.


Three of the functions were later altered and added to a class.
This was then used to make a simple GUI that allows a user to upload a FASTA file (a text-based format for representing nucleotide sequences),
and perform the calculations/algorithms.

the pysimplegui file can be easily changed to incoorperate more functions, simply by adding them to the dictionary called funcs.
